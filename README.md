# EcoBite
This is a React web application featuring a user-friendly, interactive calculator for carbon emissions from various protein sources. After the user provides their protein consumption quantities, it shows total carbon emissions, a detailed breakdown by protein type, and two comparison metrics; miles driven by car, and hours using a desktop computer.

This is a final project for ENV-12: Climate Action at Tufts University, in Fall 2024.

## Usage
Visit [the GitHub pages website](https://jack898.github.io/ecobite/) to use the calculator.

## More Information
For detailed information about our equations for calculating carbon emissions and the comparison metrics, see the "Sources" tab on the EcoBite website.
