      <h2>Our Goal</h2>
      <p>About a fourth of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to food systems. Based on current trends, food production will emit about 1,360 billion tonnes of greenhouse gasses between 2020 and 2100 which is over double the carbon budget of 500 billion tonnes across all sectors to keep global warming below 1.5â„ƒ. Meat production is inefficient at turning animals into calories: Beef has a 25/1 ratio of input/output calories, pork is 15/1, and chicken is 9/1. Therefore, targeting the consumer attitude surrounding excessive meat consumption is an essential piece for a greener future. EcoBite aims to spread awareness to consumers about their impact on the environment to encourage more educated and thoughtful food choices.</p> 
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>We're a group of Tufts University undergraduate students in a variety of majors. This is our final project for ENV-12: Climate Action in Fall 2024.</p>
